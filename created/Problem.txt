Problem
	A is a painter with an interest in color-by-number pictures. Naturally, as a painter, they have little money with which to pursue their hobby.
	Recently, however, they have been approached by some investors who share their interests in pushing the bounds of artistic freedom and creativity.

	The investors have offered A a handsome amount for a collection of paintings and A, as a poor, senseless artist, eagerly accepted before considering
	How much it would cost him to paint. Unfortunately for A, this is the one week of the year where the entire French populace is not on strike and,
	As a result, the cost of painting supplies has skyrocketed. 

	Luckily, the investors never specified how many colors they wanted A to use for the paintings, only that no adjacent "cells" share the same color.
	Hardpressed for time, A has asked for your help in figuring out the optimal way to color the paintings so that he saves the most money. Being an artist,
	Though, A is mainly concerned about the profitability of the whole order, resolving to go out in a "blaze of Dadist glory" if he should lose money, and
	Is content to merely know whether, on an individual painting, they are making or losing money.

Input
	The first line contains a single positive integer C (C > 0) indicating the number of different paint colors that A can use.
	The next C lines contain a string-integer pair specifiying a color and it's current market price.
	Following the last color line, is any number of cases (> 0), each specifying a specific painting that was ordered by the investors.

	The first line of a case consists of a string P, an integer V (> 0), and an integer N (2 < N < 27).
	P is the painting's name, with hypen's taking the place of spaces. V is the amount that the investors have 

	The next N lines contain a description of the painting's cells.
	Each line begins with a single character L representing a unique cell in the painting.
	The rest of the line describes the set of all cells adjacent to L in the painting.

Output
	For each painting, print the name of the painting and whether it is a profit, loss, or neither for A.
	Following the paintings, print the total profit for the order, with a + specifying gains and a - specifying losses.
